# Historical Wildfires Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains Python code for analyzing historical wildfire data. The code utilizes various data visualization techniques to explore patterns and trends in wildfire occurrences, estimated fire area, brightness, radiative power, and confidence levels across different regions in Australia.

## Features
- **Data Acquisition:** The code fetches historical wildfire data from a publicly available dataset.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Date manipulation and data type conversion are performed to prepare the data for analysis.
- **Visualization:** Various plots and charts are generated using libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Folium to visualize different aspects of wildfire data.
- **Insights:** The code provides insights into trends in estimated fire area, brightness, radiative power, confidence levels, and their distribution across regions.
- **Interactive Map:** An interactive map using Folium displays the locations of seven regions in Australia with marked coordinates.
